=================================
USB Multi-pupose Floppy Interface
=================================

This device allows floppy disks to be read and written using a low cost
USB interface and a generic floppy disk drive. It is targetted at
Amiga floppy disks but may support others. Currently only DD disks
are supported due to USB FS bandwidth constraints.

Data is read and written in raw flux format and will be stored in SCP
format for for maximum compatibility and flexibility.

This project is a work in progress.
